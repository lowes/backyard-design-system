## Pull Requests

Merge requests are a great way to get your ideas into this repository.

When deciding if we merge in a pull request, we look at the following things:

### Does it state intent

You should be clear about which problem you're trying to solve with your
contribution.

For example:

> Add link to code of conduct in README.md

Doesn't tell us anything about why you're doing that

> Add link to code of conduct in README.md because users don't always look in the CONTRIBUTING.md

Tells us the problem that you have found, and the merge request shows us the action you have taken to solve it.

### Is it of good quality

- There are no spelling mistakes
- It reads well
- It passes all lint rules
- It has updated unit / snapshot tests that pass

### Does it move this product closer to our vision

The aim of this repository is documented at [README](README.md).

### Does it follow the contributor covenant

This repository has a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), we will remove things that do not respect it.
